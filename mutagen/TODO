mutagen.id3 needs:
 * Specify all known frames
 * Implement delete to completely remove all trace of the ID3
 * Detect tags in non-beginning locations, particularly if multiple
   separate version tags exist at the beginning of the file
 * Perhaps implement tag merging - "intelligently" merge information
   from all known tag formats
 * Polish padding - perhaps make it client selectable
