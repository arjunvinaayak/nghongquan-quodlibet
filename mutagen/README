Mutagen is an ID3 reader and writer implemented in pure Python. It
supports reading ID3v1.1, 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4, and writing 2.4 and 1.1.

The goals are (in rough order of importance):
 * Read as many MP3 files as possible
 * Compatibility with as many other tag readers and editors as possible 
 * Compliance with the ID3 spec
 * Written in Pythonic Python, with a Pythonic API
 * Unit and regression test suite
 * Support all features of the ID3 format
 * Easily extensible to new frames

Testing the Module
------------------
To test Mutagen's reading support, run
 $ ./_pony.py <your top-level MP3 directory here>
Mutagen will try to load all of them, and report any errors.

To look at the tags in MP3s, run
 $ ./id3inspect filename.mp3 ...

To run our test suite,
 $ ./_sanity.sh

Compatibility
-------------
If you have eyeD3 installed, some cross-compatibility tests are done as
part of the test suite (./_sanity.sh) to make sure eyeD3 can read tags
written by Mutagen.

Although not yet automated, we have tested our tags with TagLib and MAD's
libid3tag, and they are both capable of reading tags written by Mutagen.

As we write ID3v2.4 tags, id3lib cannot read them. However, if you enable
ID3v1 tag saving (pass v1=2 to ID3.save), id3lib will read that.
