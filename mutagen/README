Mutagen is an ID3 reader and writer implemented in pure Python. It
supports reading ID3v1.1, 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4. Writing is untested, but
it will write ID3v2.4 (and ID3v1.1) tags.

The goals are (in rough order of importance):
 * Read as many MP3 files as possible
 * Compatibility with as many other tag readers and editors as possible 
 * Compliance with the ID3 spec
 * Written in Pythonic Python, with a Pythonic API
 * Unit and regression test suite
 * Support all features of the ID3 format
 * Easily extensible to new frames

Testing the Reader
------------------
To test Mutagen, run
 $ ./_pony.py <your top-level MP3 directory here>
Mutagen will try to load all of them, and report any errors.
