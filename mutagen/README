Mutagen is an audio metadata tag reader and writer implemented in pure
Python. It currently supports reading ID3v1.1, ID3v2.2, ID3v2.3, ID3v2.4,
APEv2, and FLAC, and writing ID3v1.1, ID3v2.4, APEv2, and FLAC.

Mutagen began as an ID3v2-specific module, but as we implemented more
metadata formats, we also included them in the Mutagen namespace.

The goals are (in rough order of importance):
 * Read as many files as possible
 * Compatibility with as many other tag readers and editors as possible 
 * Compliance with the relevant specifications
 * Written in Pythonic Python, with a Pythonic API
 * Unit and regression test suite
 * Provide access to all features of the supported formats
 * Easily extensible

Testing the Module
------------------
To test Mutagen's ID3 reading support, run
 $ ./_pony.py <your top-level MP3 directory here>
Mutagen will try to load all of them, and report any errors.

To look at the ID3 or APEv2 tags in files, run
 $ ./taginspect filename ...

To run our test suite,
 $ ./_sanity.sh

Compatibility
-------------
If you have eyeD3 installed, some cross-compatibility tests are done as
part of the test suite (./_sanity.sh) to make sure eyeD3 can read tags
written by Mutagen.

Although not yet automated, we have tested our tags with TagLib and MAD's
libid3tag, and they are both capable of reading tags written by Mutagen.

As we write ID3v2.4 tags, id3lib cannot read them. However, if you enable
ID3v1 tag saving (pass v1=2 to ID3.save), id3lib will read that.
