These are bindings for the TagLib library generated using the Boost Python
Library. I am writing them because I hate SWIG, which python-taglib uses.

The goal is complete coverage of the generic and file-specific APIs,
focusing on Ogg Vorbis (for testing), MP3, FLAC, and MPC, in that order.
Unit and regression test coverage is a primary design goal. The ability
to implement File and Tag subclasses in Python is not a primary design goal,
but would be cool.

Requirements:
	TagLib: http://developer.kde.org/~wheeler/taglib
	Boost Python: http://www.boost.org/libs/python/
