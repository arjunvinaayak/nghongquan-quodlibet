Musepack in Python
------------------
This Python module lets you load and decode Musepack (MPC/MP+ files).
Its API has been chosen to mostly match pyvorbis and pymad. It also
includes a module to read and write APEv2 metadata tags.

libmpcdec can be found at http://www.musepack.net/index.php?pg=src.

Compiling:
----------
This module has only been tested on Python 2.3. It definitely won't
work on 2.1 or earlier. It also requires libmpcdec 1.2.

$ ./setup.py build

Usage:
------
$ pydoc musepack.mpc
$ pydoc musepack.apev2

See 'plaympc.py' for an example of a simple player.
