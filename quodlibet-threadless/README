Ex Falso / Quod Libet - A Music Library/Editor/Player
========================================================================
Quod Libet is a music library management program. Rather than categorize
songs by genre, artist, and album, it lets you search and display them
however you want. Ex Falso is a tag editor that has the same editing
features found in Quod Libet, but does not play audio files.

EF/QL support the Ogg Vorbis, FLAC, MP3, MOD/XM/IT, and MPC file formats
for playback. Tag editing and other features may vary from format to format.

====[ Using EF/QL
To run the programs, use
 $ ./quodlibet.py
or
 $ ./exfalso.py

After installing, you can just run `quodlibet' or `exfalso'.

For help on using them, run
 $ man -l ./quodlibet.1

Or visit http://www.sacredchao.net/quodlibet/wiki/Guide.

Whenever you upgrade, it's a good idea to select "Reload library" from
the Music menu. This upgrades your library to take advantage of new
tag features found in the release. You should also read the NEWS
file for any important upgrade notes.
