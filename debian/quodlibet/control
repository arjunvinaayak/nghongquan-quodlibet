Description: audio library manager and player for GTK+
 Quod Libet is a music library management program. Rather than categorize
 songs by genre, artist, and album, it lets you search and display them
 however you want. It supports regexp-based searches, album cover display,
 tag editing, ReplayGain, multimedia keys, and an OSD.
 .
 Also included is Ex Falso, a tag editor that has the same editing features
 found in Quod Libet, but does not play audio files.
 .
 Supported formats include MP3, Ogg Vorbis, FLAC, Musepack (MPC), and
 MOD/XM/IT (with appropriate extensions installed).
 .
 Quod Libet and Ex Falso are written in Python and use PyGTK+.
