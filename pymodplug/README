ModPlug Player in Python
------------------------
This Python module lets you load and decode files supported by the ModPlug
library (which includes MODs, ITs, XMs, and so on). Its API has been chosen
to mostly match pyvorbis and pymad.

libmodplug can be found at http://modplug-xmms.sourceforge.net.

It uses (and requires) the ctypes FFI, which can be found at
http://starship.python.net/crew/theller/ctypes/.

Compiling:
----------
$ make && su -c "make install"

Usage:
------
modplug uses Python docstrings as its primary form of documentation.
>>> import modplug; help(modplug)

See 'playmod.py' for an example of a simple player.
